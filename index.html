    <h2>[PerfNA] Performance of host-based Network Applications</h2>
    <p>
        With the advancement of highly network-powered paradigms like 5G, Microservices, etc. which are typically deployed as containers/VMs, there is a growing imperative on the host nodes to perform specialized network tasks like monitoring, filtering, tunneling, load-balancing, etc. While traditionally, these tasks were performed using switches and specialized middleboxes in the network, there is a demand to perform these network tasks on commodity hardware comprising of COTS servers. However, a major challenge is to perform these tasks at low-overhead and high reliability while maintaining low latency, high throughput, and flexibility.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recently, there are several approaches from academia and industry for building such high-performance network applications. The proposed solutions are built on different high-speed packet processing targets such as DPDK (Data Plane Development Toolkit), eBPF(Extended Berkeley Packet Filter), P4-based smart NICs, DPUs, IPUs, OVS, RDMA, FPGA, etc, each has its own compiler toolchain, accelerators, and programming interface for developers. Some prior work also leverages these solutions for optimizing the TCP stack which benefits these applications deployed on COTS servers.
    </p>
    <p>
        This workshop is focused on understanding the performance aspects of network applications built over such tools and targets. With several heterogeneous approaches available at the hosts, there is a need for dedicated discussions in this area to understand the pros/cons of using different approaches to solve different network issues, and how these different approaches can converge into a unified framework at the host. We hope this workshop could serve as a catalyst to initiate discussion both among industry and academia on how host-based tools can be leveraged to solve complex network issues and encourage its wide adaptability.
    </p>

                Abstract : In this paper, we consider the challenges that arise from the need to scale virtualized network functions (VNFs) at 100 Gbps line speed and beyond. Traditional VNF designs are
monolithic in state management and scheduling: internally maintaining all states and operations associated with them. Without proper design considerations, it suffers from limitations when scaling at 100 Gbps link speed and beyond:
the inability of efficient utilization of the cache because of the contention due to the frequent control plane activities, computational/memory-intensive tasks taking up CPU times,
shares states causing the synchronization among the cores. We address these limitations by arguing for the need to granularly decompose a VNF into data/control components
that are co-located within a server but can be independently scaled among the cores. To realize the approach, we design a "serverless" programming framework with novel abstraction
to optimize the data components that must process packets at the line speed, reduce the contention of the data states and enable run-time scheduling of different components for
improved resource utilization. The abstractions, combined with the runtime system that we design, help NFV developers focus on the logic and correctness of VNF programming
without worrying about how VNFs may be scaled in or out. We evaluate our platform by comparing it with monolithic approaches using different workloads and by analyzing its
advantages of separation on scalability, performance determinism, and feature velocity.

                <b>Absract:</b> When a packet traverses the network towards a destination It encounters several network switches. These network switches executes a series of functions on the packet.  We observe that these functions are repetitive. Then we introduce the notion of cooperation among consecutive switches to reduce repetition. We formulate this as an optimization of cooperative network functions. The rest of the talk will present our cooperative parsing and routing works in detail.

                Abstract: Network Functions (NFs) such as Firewall, IDS and load-balancers demand low latency and high throughput to improve application performance and lower costs. While the status-quo has been to buy specialized devices to implement NFs, there is a growing trend to implement these NFs on commodity servers. Such designs offer high "programmability" and faster development cycles, but suffer from high latency and low throughput per instance by processing packets in the software. On the other hand, P4 and Broadcom based switches offer low latency and ultra-high throughput. We believe that hardware-software co-design offers a sweet spot to get the best of switches and software. In this work, we show how to build such a hybrid design using load-balancer as an example. We show that such a design can substantially improve latency, throughput, availability at a fraction of costs.

Server application designers have offloaded their computations to programmable network hardware to increase application throughput, reduce  latency, and save server CPUs.
                This talk will introduce programmable networking concepts and describe state-of-the-art application offloads. Such application offloads have resulted in newer research domains, such as the design of frameworks for programming abstractions, network management, and security.

                Abstract: Edge clouds are deployed to provide very responsive services to the end-users.  Especially, the increasing demand for cloud-based inference services requires the use of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). However, the Edge resources such as CPUs and GPUs are limited and must be shared across multiple concurrently running clients. It is highly desirable to multiplex different inference tasks on the GPU and utilize the GPUs efficiently. Batched processing, CUDA streams and Multi-process-service (MPS) help. However, we find that these are not adequate for achieving scalability and do not guarantee predictable performance. Further, edge servers require considerable amounts of streaming data to be processed and account for load variations.

                In this talk, I will present  our NFV platform GSLICE.  GSLICE incorporates a dynamic GPU resource allocation and management framework to maximize performance and resource utilization. We virtualize the GPU by apportioning the GPU resources across different Inference Functions (IFs), thus providing isolation and guaranteeing performance. We develop controlled spatial sharing of GPU, self-learning and adaptive GPU resource allocation and batching schemes that account for network traffic characteristics, while also keeping inference latencies below service level objectives. GSLICE adapts quickly to the streaming data’s workload intensity and the variability of GPU processing costs. GSLICE provides scalability of the GPU for IF processing through efficient and controlled spatial multiplexing, coupled with a GPU resource reallocation scheme with minimal (< 100 microseconds) downtime. Compared to TensorRT and default MPS, GSLICE significantly improves GPU utilization efficiency and achieves 2-13x improvement in aggregate throughput.

                Abstract: State-of-the-art approaches to design, develop and optimize software packet-processing programs are based on static compilation: the compiler’s input is a description of the forwarding plane semantics and the output is a binary that can accommodate any control plane configuration or input traffic.
In this talk, I will demonstrate that tracking control plane actions and packet-level traffic dynamics at run time opens up new opportunities for code specialization. I will present Morpheus, a system working alongside static compilers that continuously optimizes the targeted networking code. Morpheus introduces a number of new techniques, from static code analysis to adaptive code instrumentation, together with a toolbox of domain specific optimizations that are not restricted to a specific data plane framework or programming language. We applied Morpheus to several eBPF and DPDK programs including Katran, Facebook’s production-grade load balancer, showing considerable improvement both in terms of throughput and latency.

                Abstract: The state-of-the-art dataplane languages, like P4, and hardware architectures use domain-specific primitives such as programmable parsers and match-action tables to enable flexible and efficient processing of packets. Unfortunately, P4 programs tend to be monolithic and tightly coupled to the hardware architecture, which makes it hard to write programs in a portable and modular way-e.g., by composing reusable libraries of standard protocols. First, we will discuss various research challenges in writing library modules and target-architecture independent programs. Next, I will present the design and implementation of a novel framework (μP4) comprising a lightweight logical architecture that abstracts away from the structure of the underlying targets and naturally supports powerful forms of program composition. Using examples, we show how μP4 enables modular programming. Next, I will present a prototype of the compiler that generates code for multiple lower-level architectures, including Barefoot’s Tofino Native Architecture. We evaluate the overheads induced by our compiler on realistic examples. We will briefly discuss possible optimizations. Finally, we will revisit the same research challenges for SmartNICs and Control Plane to draw a roadmap for future research opportunities.
